# 🛒 Go Grocery – Android Grocery Delivery Application

## 1. Abstract

Go Grocery is an Android-based grocery delivery application designed to simplify the process of purchasing daily grocery items. The app allows users to browse products by category, add items to a cart, and place orders dynamically. Firebase is used as a backend service to manage user authentication, real-time database operations, and cloud storage. The system reduces manual shopping effort and provides a scalable, secure, and efficient solution suitable for real-world and academic projects.

## 2. Working of the System

The Go Grocery application follows a client–server architecture using Firebase as the backend:

1. User registers or logs in using Firebase Authentication.
2. After login, the user is redirected to the Home Screen.
3. Products are fetched dynamically from Firebase Firestore.
4. Users can browse categories such as Vegetables, Fruits, Dairy, Snacks, and Drinks.
5. Selected products are added to the cart and stored in Firestore.
6. During checkout, order details are saved in the Orders collection.
7. Admin can manage products and update order status through Firebase Console.
8. Users can view order history and profile details.
