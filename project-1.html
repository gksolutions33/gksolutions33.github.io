# Resume Screening for HR Round

The HR Interview Screening Chatbot is a cloud-based intelligent system that automates the initial stages of recruitment.
It simulates a real-world hiring workflow used by companies:

**"Resume → Application → ATS Filter → Mail"**
---
**"Mail→ Assessment Link → Assessment Scoring → HR Shortlist"**
---

The system uses **Streamlit + Python** for the applicant interface, **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS** for assessment
interface, **Snowflake** as the data warehouse, **Azure** for deployment and email automation, and **Power BI** for
recruiter dashboards.

The goal of the project is to reduce recruiter workload and shortlist the most relevant candidates using a transparent
and explainable AI scoring system.

## Key Features

### Admin Page
Job description is available here. Assessment questions depend on JD. Keywords are also in JD.

### 1. Candidate Application Portal (Streamlit)
- Candidate fills an application form
- Uploads PDF resume
- Stores submission in Snowflake
- Shows message: "Assessment link will be emailed if your resume passes ATS filter"

### 2. ATS Resume Filtering (Python + NLP)
- Keywords and skill extraction
- Semantic similarity scoring
- Computes ATS Score (0–100)
- If ATS score ≥ threshold, an assessment link is emailed

### 3. Assessment Workflow
- Candidate receives secure link via email
- Takes the MCQ/coding assessment
- System auto-grades and stores the result
- Assessment score is compared with the threshold

### 4. Final Composite Scoring
For candidates who pass both gates, the system evaluates:
- Resume Score
- Application Form Answer Score
- Assessment Score

All three are combined to calculate a composite AI score.

### 5. Recruiter Dashboard (Power BI)
- Displays top candidates
- Filters by ATS, Assessment, and Final Score
- View resume information and summaries
- Provides transparent score breakdowns

## Why This Project Is Useful

Recruiters handle thousands of applications. Manually checking resumes, distributing assessments, scoring results, and
shortlisting candidates is slow.

This system automates:
- Resume screening
- Assessment distribution
- Scoring
- Shortlisting
- Candidate ranking

It improves fairness, consistency, and reduces workload by 70–80%.

---

## Process Flow

### 1. Candidate Submission
Candidates visit the Streamlit app and:
- Fill personal details
- Upload resume (PDF only)
- Answer basic application questions

Data is stored in Snowflake.

### 2. ATS Scoring
ATS score is calculated using:
- Extracted skills
- Keywords
- Role requirements
- Semantic similarity

If ATS Score ≥ ATS_MIN, the candidate moves forward.
If not, the application ends.

### 3. Assessment Link Generation
If ATS passes:
- The system generates a secure assessment token
- Sends the assessment link to the candidate's email

### 4. Candidate Completes Assessment
Candidate takes the assessment, which may include:
- MCQs
- Optional coding tasks

### 5. Assessment Gate
If Assessment Score ≥ ASSESSMENT_MIN, the candidate proceeds to HR evaluation.
Otherwise, the candidate is rejected.

### 6. Composite AI Scoring
For candidates who pass both gates:

```
final_score = 0.4 * resume_score + 0.3 * application_score + 0.3 * assessment_score
```

A detailed score breakdown is stored for transparency.

### 7. Recruiter Shortlist
The Power BI dashboard shows:
- Final Score
- ATS Score
- Assessment Score
- Resume keywords
- Application answers

Recruiters review only the shortlisted profiles.
