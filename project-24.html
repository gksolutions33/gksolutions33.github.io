# Vitamin Deficiency Prediction Based on User Symptoms

# ✅ **Vitamin Deficiency Prediction Based on Symptoms**

A **machine-learning + rule-based** health-support system that identifies possible vitamin deficiencies based on symptoms that the user enters and provides:

✔ Predicted vitamin deficiency
✔ Food sources to correct the deficiency
✔ Daily lifestyle changes
✔ Supplement suggestions (non-medical, general)
✔ Preventive tips

> **Important:** This is not a medical diagnosis system; it gives educational predictions.

# 🧠 **How the System Works**

There are two ways to build it:

---

## **1️⃣ Rule-Based Prediction System (Simple & Highly Accurate for Symptoms)**

Each symptom is mapped to possible vitamin deficiencies.

### **Example Mapping**

| Symptom             | Possible Deficiency       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Hair loss           | Vitamin B7 (Biotin), D, E |
| Fatigue             | B12, D, Iron              |
| Cracked lips        | B2, B6                    |
| Vision problems     | Vitamin A                 |
| Weak immunity       | Vitamin C, D              |
| Tingling hands/feet | B1, B6, B12               |
| Bone/joint pain     | Vitamin D, Calcium        |
| Dry skin            | A, E                      |
| Mouth ulcers        | B9, B12                   |

The system checks all symptoms the user enters and predicts one or more deficiencies.

---

## **2️⃣ ML-Based Prediction (If You Want AI Model)**

### Dataset structure:

| symptom1    | symptom2     | symptom3 | …       | vitamin_deficiency |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| hair loss   | fatigue      | dry skin | …       | Vitamin D          |
| mouth ulcer | cracked lips | …        | Vit B12 |                    |

Train using:
✔ Random Forest
✔ SVM
✔ Decision Trees
✔ Neural networks (simple MLP)

# 🧰 **Project Workflow**

1. **User enters symptoms**
   Example: “fatigue, hair loss, tingling feet”

2. **Symptom → Deficiency Prediction**
   Using rule-based or ML model.

3. **Generate output:**

   * vitamin deficiency
   * recommended foods
   * lifestyle changes
   * supplement recommendations
   * warning when to see a doctor

---

# 🎯 **Final Output Example**

### **Input:**

*“Hair fall, fatigue, tingling feet”*

### **Prediction:**

➡ **Likely Vitamin B12 Deficiency**
➡ Possible: **Vitamin D**, **Biotin**

---

## 🥗 Food Suggestions

### **For Vitamin B12**

* Eggs
* Milk, curd
* Fish (salmon, tuna)
* Lean chicken
* Fortified cereals

### **For Vitamin D**

* Sunlight (morning 20 mins)
* Mushrooms
* Fortified milk
* Egg yolk

### **For Biotin (B7)**

* Almonds
* Walnuts
* Sweet potatoes
* Whole grains

---

## 💊 Home Remedies (Non-Medical)

* Include **curd + banana** for gut health
* **1 tsp flaxseed** daily for skin & hair
* **Moringa powder** (rich in B-complex)

---

## 🏃 Lifestyle Recommendations

* 20–30 min morning sunlight daily
* Reduce junk food & sugar
* Follow regular sleep schedule (7–8 hrs)
* Reduce stress with breathing exercises
* Drink 2.5–3 liters of water daily

---

## ⚠ “When to See a Doctor”

* Long-term numbness/tingling
* Extreme fatigue
* Unexplained weight loss
* Severe hair loss

# 🗂 Project Modules (for your academic submission)

### **1. Symptom Input Module**

User enters symptoms via text or list checklist.

### **2. Preprocessing Module**

Tokenize → map symptoms → dataset encoding.

### **3. Prediction Engine**

* **Rule-based JSON** mapping
* OR **ML model.pkl** prediction

### **4. Recommendation Module**

* Food
* Lifestyle
* Remedies

https://github.com/shivasaisanga/vitamin-deficiency-prediction-and-food-recommendation.git
* Prevention tips

### **5. Report Generation**

Shows final predicted deficiency with suggestions.
