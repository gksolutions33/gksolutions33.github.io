# Road Condition Monitoring – AI-Based Pothole Detection

This project uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically detect road damages such as potholes from a standard camera feed. Using a YOLO-based deep learning model and OpenCV, the system analyzes each video frame to identify potholes and then generates a professional PDF report with material estimates and repair budget. The entire pipeline runs automatically on a laptop using Python.

---

## Features

- YOLO-based pothole detection on road videos (e.g., dashcam footage).
- Live detection window showing bounding boxes around potholes.
- De-duplication logic so each pothole is counted only once across frames.
- Automatic estimation per pothole:
  - Length and width (approximate)
  - Sand (kg), Cement (kg), Rocks (kg), Coal Tar (liters)
  - Individual pothole repair budget
- Aggregated “Materials & Cost Summary”:
  - Total sand, cement, rocks and coal tar required
  - Total material costs + labour cost
  - Final estimated repair budget
- Professional letter-style PDF report addressed to road authorities.
- Automatic email sending of the PDF report via Gmail.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Windows (tested) with VS Code or any IDE
- Gmail account with App Password enabled

Python packages:

```
ultralytics
opencv-python
reportlab
python-dotenv
```

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/road-condition-monitoring.git
cd road-condition-monitoring/R_C_M
```

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)

```
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```
pip install ultralytics opencv-python reportlab python-dotenv
```

### 4. Add your YOLO model and sample video

Place the following in the `R_C_M` folder:

- `best.pt` – your trained YOLOv8/YOLOv11 pothole detector.
- `potholes_video.mp4` – sample road inspection video.

### 5. Create `.env` file for email

Create a file named `.env` in `R_C_M` (same folder as `auto_pothole_report.py`):

```
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
```

Use a Gmail **App Password**, not your normal password (from Google Account → Security → 2‑Step Verification → App passwords).

### 6. Configure report details (optional)

Open `auto_pothole_report.py` and adjust these variables near the top:

```
VIDEO_PATH = "potholes_video.mp4"
MODEL_PATH = "best.pt"
GUIDE_EMAIL = "road.authority@example.com"
GUIDE_NAME = "Road Authority Officer"
ROAD_NAME = "NH-44"
AREA_NAME = "Bangalore-Chennai Highway Section"
```

---

## How to Run (Single Command)

From inside the activated virtual environment:

```
cd R_C_M
python auto_pothole_report.py
```

The script will:

1. Open a live window showing pothole detections on the video.
2. Automatically de-duplicate detections and estimate materials per pothole.
3. Generate `pothole_detection_report.pdf` in the same folder.
4. Email the PDF report to `GUIDE_EMAIL` using the credentials from `.env`.

---

## Output Report

The generated PDF contains:

- Formal letter addressed to the specified road authority.
- Short description of the inspected road segment.
- Table of each pothole with:
  - ID, length, width, detection accuracy
  - Sand (kg), cement (kg), rocks (kg), coal tar (liters)
  - Individual pothole repair budget
- “Materials & Cost Summary” table with total quantities and costs.
- Final total estimated budget for repairing all detected potholes.
```
