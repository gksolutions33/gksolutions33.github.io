# CertiSecure - Secure Marksheet Generator & Validator

CertiSecure is a web application designed to generate tamper-proof marksheet PDFs and validate them using cryptographic hashing and strict content verification.

## Features

### 1. Secure Generation
-   **Data Hashing**: Creates a SHA-256 hash of the student's text details (Name, Marks, etc.).
-   **Image Hashing**: Normalizes the profile photo to JPEG and calculates its SHA-256 hash to prevent format-based verification errors.
-   **QR Code Embedding**: Embeds a QR code containing the digital signature (hashes) of both the text and the image.
-   **Visual Security**: Adds a visual border to the profile photo and embeds the specific JPEG stream that was hashed.

### 2. Strict Validation
-   **Content Extraction**: Extracts raw text and images from the uploaded PDF.
-   **Integrity Check**: Re-calculates hashes of the extracted content and compares them byte-for-byte with the data stored in the QR code.
-   **Visual Tamper Detection**: Automatically fails validation if any PDF annotations or overlays (common in "fill and sign" editors) are detected.
-   **Feedback**: Provides detailed pass/fail reports for text, photo, and visual layer integrity.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Pip (Python Package Manager)

## Installation Guide

1.  **Clone/Download** this project folder.
2.  **Open a terminal** inside the project folder.
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Step-by-Step Usage

### Starting the Server
Run the application using Python:
```bash
python app.py
```
The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Generating a Marksheet
1.  Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2.  Fill in the form (Name, Father's Name, Institution, Roll No, Marks).
3.  Upload a Profile Photo (JPG/PNG).
4.  Click **Generate Secured PDF**.
5.  The secured PDF will run and download automatically.

### Validating a Marksheet
1.  Go to the **Validate Document** section on the home page.
2.  Upload a Marksheet PDF (either the original or a generic file).
3.  Click **Run Verification**.
4.  **Check the Results**:
    -   **Authentic**: All hashes match, and no tampering detected.
    -   **Invalid / Tampered**: The text or photo has been changed, or someone added visual annotations.

## Technical Notes
-   **Image Handling**: To ensure consistency, all uploaded photos are converted to JPEG quality 95 before hashing. This ensures the hash stored in the QR always matches the image embedded in the PDF.
-   **Libraries Used**: 
    -   `Flask` (Web Framework)
    -   `ReportLab` (PDF Generation)
    -   `PyMuPDF (fitz)` (PDF Reading/Extraction)
    -   `OpenCV` (QR Code Detection)
    -   `Pillow` (Image Processing)
