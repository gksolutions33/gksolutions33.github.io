1. Project Title

IoT-Based Smart Parking and Vehicle Occupancy Detection System with Mobile Application

2. Project Description

The IoT-Based Smart Parking and Vehicle Occupancy System is designed to efficiently monitor parking spaces in real time and provide instant updates to users through a mobile application.
This system detects whether parking slots are occupied or vacant using sensors and image processing techniques, sends the data to a cloud server, and displays the live parking status on a mobile app.

The primary goal of the project is to reduce parking congestion, save time, and improve user convenience by allowing users to check parking availability before entering a parking area. The system also helps parking administrators manage parking spaces more effectively.

The system integrates IoT hardware, cloud services, computer vision (optional), and mobile application development to create a smart, scalable, and real-time parking solution.

3. Project Objectives

To detect vehicle presence in parking slots accurately

To identify empty and occupied parking spaces in real time

To send live parking data to a cloud database

To display parking availability on a mobile application

To reduce traffic congestion and parking search time

To improve efficient utilization of parking spaces

4. System Working (High-Level Flow)

Sensors or camera monitor each parking slot

Vehicle presence is detected (occupied / empty)

Data is sent to cloud server (Firebase / IoT platform)

Cloud processes and stores parking status

Mobile application fetches real-time data

User views available parking slots on the app
