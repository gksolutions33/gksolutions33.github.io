# Heart-disease-detection-naive-bayesian
📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly reduce mortality rates and improve patient outcomes. This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Heart Disease Prediction System using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

The system analyzes patient health parameters and predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease. It provides both command-line and web-based interfaces, making it easy to use for healthcare applications.

🎯 Objectives

To predict heart disease using machine learning techniques

To implement the Naive Bayes classifier for medical data analysis

To develop a user-friendly web interface for prediction

To assist doctors and patients in early diagnosis

To achieve reliable prediction accuracy with minimal computational cost
