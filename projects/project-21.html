# Blockchain-Based Student-Teacher-Admin Network

A decentralized application (DApp) for managing academic interactions securely on the blockchain.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Ganache
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Web3.js
- **Wallet**: MetaMask

## Prerequisites
1. **Google Chrome** with [MetaMask Extension](https://metamask.io/) installed.
2. [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) (Quickstart workspace).
3. VS Code (to edit code if needed).

## Setup & Deployment Steps

### 1. Setup Blockchain (Ganache)
1. Open **Ganache** and click **"Quickstart"**.
2. Note the **RPC Server** URL (usually `HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545`) and the **Chain ID** (usually `1337`).

### 2. Configure MetaMask
1. Open MetaMask and add a new network manually:
   - **Network Name**: Ganache Local
   - **RPC URL**: `HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545`
   - **Chain ID**: `1337`
   - **Currency Symbol**: ETH
2. Import an Account:
   - Copy a **Private Key** from one of the accounts in Ganache.
   - Initialise MetaMask -> Click Circle Icon -> Import Account -> Paste Private Key.

### 3. Deploy Smart Contract (Remix IDE)
1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file `UnifiedNetwork.sol` and copy the content from the local `UnifiedNetwork.sol` file in this folder.
3. **Compile**: Go to "Solidity Compiler" tab -> Click "Compile UnifiedNetwork.sol".

4. **Deploy**:
   - Go to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
   - Set **Environment** to **"Injected Provider - MetaMask"**. (Make sure MetaMask is connected to Ganache).
   - Click **"Deploy"**.
5. **Copy Address**: After deployment, scroll down to "Deployed Contracts", copy the contract address (e.g., `0x123...`).

### 4. Connect Frontend
1. Open `app.js` in this folder.
2. Replace `"YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE"` with the address you just copied.
   ```javascript
   const contractAddress = "0xYourCopiedAddress...";
   ```
3. Save the file.

### 5. Run the Application
1. You can simply double-click `index.html` to open it in Chrome (or use Live Server extension in VS Code for better experience).
2. **Login Admin**: The account used to deploy the contract is the **Admin**. Connect with that account on `index.html`.
3. **Add Teacher**: Use Admin dashboard to register a new Teacher address (pick another address from Ganache).
4. **Login Teacher**: Switch MetaMask account to the Teacher address, reload `index.html` and login.
5. **Add Student**: Use Teacher dashboard to register a Student address.
6. **Login Student**: Switch MetaMask account to Student address, reload `index.html` and login.

## Troubleshooting
- **"Connection Failed"**: Ensure Ganache is running and MetaMask is on the correct network.
- **"Contract Connection Failed"**: Verify `contractAddress` in `app.js` matches the deployed address in Remix.
