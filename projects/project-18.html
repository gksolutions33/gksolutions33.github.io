# Skin Disease Prediction AI

This project is a Deep Learning application designed to classify various skin diseases from images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and provides a user-friendly **Flask** web interface for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- **High-Accuracy Classification**: Trained on a diverse dataset of skin conditions.
- **Web Interface**: Modern, responsive web app for easy image upload and analysis.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Fast predictions with confidence scores.
- **CLI Support**: Command-line scripts for batch processing or quick checks.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. You will need the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Flask
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for training visualization)

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow flask numpy matplotlib
    ```

## 🖥️ usage

### 1. Running the Web Application (Recommended)
This starts the local web server where you can upload images via a graphical interface.

1.  Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  Wait for the message: `Model loaded successfully`.
3.  Open your web browser and go to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```
4.  Drag and drop an image or click to upload, then click **"Analyze Image"**.

### 2. Training the Model
If you want to retrain the model with new data:

1.  Ensure your data is organized in `data set/train` and `data set/test` with subfolders for each class.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    This will save the new model as `skin_disease_model.keras`.

### 3. Evaluating the Model
To check the accuracy and loss on the test dataset:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

### 4. Command Line Prediction
To predict a single image without starting the web server:

1.  Open `predict.py` and modify the image path at the bottom.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

## ⚠️ Note
- The model expects images to be resized to **180x180** pixels (handled automatically by the scripts).
- Ensure the `data set` folder exists if you plan to retrain or if the app needs to load class names dynamically.
