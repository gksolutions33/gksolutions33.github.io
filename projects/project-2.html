# Image-and-text-plagiarism-detection
# Plagiarism Checker 🔍

A full-stack web application (Flask + React) to check plagiarism in uploaded text or Word documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It uses **SerpAPI** to search the web and **spaCy** to calculate content similarity.

🚧 _This project is still in development._

---

## 🔧 Features

- Upload `.txt` or `.docx` files for plagiarism analysis.
- Extracts random sentences from the document.
- Google search integration via SerpAPI to find similar content.
- NLP-powered similarity score calculation using **spaCy**.
- Displays individual sentence matches with links and scores.
- Overall plagiarism percentage.
- **Frontend built with React** for a modern UI.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The file is uploaded through the React interface.
2. The Flask backend reads and parses the document.
3. Five random sentences are selected.
4. Each sentence is searched on Google using SerpAPI (top 3 results).
5. Content from those pages is fetched and compared using `spaCy`'s similarity method.
6. Results are displayed in the frontend with links and match scores.
7. Final plagiarism percentage is calculated from all matches.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js + npm (for React frontend)
- pip (Python package manager)
- [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) API key

---

### ⚙️ Backend Setup (Flask)

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LEADisDEAD/Plagiarism-Checker.git
cd Plagiarism-Checker
```

2. **Create virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# OR
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
```

3. **Install Python dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Add your SerpAPI key**

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

```env
API_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
```

_(Do not share this key publicly or push it to GitHub.)_

5. **Download spaCy model**

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

---

### 🎨 Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Navigate to frontend folder**

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the React app**

```bash
npm start
```

4. **Frontend will run at** `http://localhost:3000` and connect to the Flask backend.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Make sure the Flask server is running on port 5000 and CORS is enabled.
- You may need to adjust the proxy in `frontend/package.json` to match your Flask backend:
```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```

- `.env` file is required both locally and in deployment (on platforms like Render or Vercel).
- Do **not commit your `.env` file** — it's already ignored via `.gitignore`.

---

## ⚠️ Alternate Backend Option

The `main.py` file has the same core logic but uses basic regex matching instead of NLP (spaCy).  
If you want a lighter and faster version with less accuracy, use this.

#  🧾Abstract
Plagiarism has become a major issue in the academic and digital world, especially with the increasing availability of online documents, articles, and media. Today, individuals can easily copy text and images from the internet, modify them, and present them as original work, leading to copyright violations and ethical concerns. Traditional plagiarism detection systems mainly focus on text-only similarity and fail to detect plagiarism involving visual content such as images. Therefore, there is a need for a modern plagiarism detection system capable of analyzing both text and images.
This project proposes a combined text and image plagiarism detection system designed to identify copied or similar content across documents and digital images. For text plagiarism detection, methods such as Natural Language Processing, tokenization, semantic similarity, and cosine similarity are used to detect exact or paraphrased plagiarism even after changing sentence structure or wording. These techniques allow deeper understanding and comparison of meaning rather than depending on direct text matching.
For image plagiarism detection, the system applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify similarities between images. Feature extraction models such as ORB, CNN and SSIM enable detection of altered, rotated, resized, filtered, or partially modified images. By matching visual patterns and pixel structures, the system accurately identifies whether an uploaded image is plagiarized or unique.
The overall goal of this project is to provide a reliable platform that can automatically detect plagiarism in textual and visual content, generate plagiarism percentage reports, and highlight matched portions. This system helps students, researchers, faculty, and content creators to maintain originality and prevent copyright violations. The combined text and image approach increases accuracy and overcomes the limitations of traditional plagiarism detectors, making the system modern, robust, and suitable for real-world applications.


#  ⚙️ 2. Working / Methodology
The plagiarism detection system works in a step-by-step pipeline:

1)User Input: The user uploads a .txt or .docx document through the React-based frontend.

2)File Processing: The Flask backend parses the document and extracts clean textual content.

3)Sentence Selection: Five random sentences are selected to represent the document.

4)Web Search: Each sentence is queried on Google via SerpAPI, retrieving the top three matching web pages.

5)Content Extraction: Textual content from the retrieved URLs is scraped.

6)NLP Similarity Analysis: spaCy’s en_core_web_md model calculates semantic similarity between the uploaded sentence and web content.

7)Score Calculation: Individual similarity scores are aggregated to compute an overall plagiarism percentage.

8)Result Display: The frontend displays sentence-wise matches, similarity scores, source links, and final plagiarism percentage.

4)🧠 Training Images / Data


✔ Training Data / Training Images Section 

Training Data:
The system uses a pre-trained Natural Language Processing model (spaCy – en_core_web_md).
No custom training images or datasets were required. The model was trained on large-scale English text corpora including news articles, web text, and Wikipedia.

📌 There are NO training images, because:

This is text plagiarism, not image ML training

No CNN / deep learning model is used
