# AI-SIEM Cyber Threat Detection System

## 🎯 Aim of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to automate the detection of cyber threats (such as network intrusions and malicious attacks) using **Artificial Intelligence**.

Traditional security systems often flood analysts with false alarms. This project uses **Deep Learning** to analyze patterns in network logs, helping to identify real threats more accurately and efficiently.

It implements the concepts from the research paper *"Cyber Threat Detection Based on Artificial Neural Networks Using Event Profiles"*, utilizing three distinct AI models:
- **FCNN**: For general pattern recognition.
- **CNN**: For detecting local anomalies in event data.
- **LSTM**: For identifying malicious sequences over time.

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed on your system.

### 1. Open in VS Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to **File > Open Folder** and select the `CS project` folder.
3. Open a **Terminal** inside VS Code (`Ctrl + ` or `Terminal > New Terminal`).

### 2. Install Dependencies (First Time Only)
In the VS Code terminal, run:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the AI Models (Important!)
Before the system can detect anything, it needs to "learn". Run this command to generate data and train the brains of the system:
```powershell
python backend/src/train.py
```
*Wait until you see "Training complete" and "Models saved". This creates the `.h5` model files in `backend/data`.*
### 4. Start the Web Dashboard
Run the main application server:
```powershell
python backend/src/app.py
```
You should see a message: `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 5. Detect Threats
1. Open your web browser (Chrome/Edge).
2. Go to: **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)**
3. **Upload Log File**: Drag and drop the `valid_test.csv` file (located in your project folder) into the upload box.
4. Click **Run AI Analysis**.
5. The AI will scan the file and display which IP addresses are "THREATS" and which are "NORMAL".

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`backend/src/train.py`**: The "Teacher". Generates synthetic data and trains the AI models.
- **`backend/src/app.py`**: The "Server". Connects the web dashboard to the Python AI.
- **`backend/src/preprocessing.py`**: The "Translator". Converts raw logs into math that the AI understands (TF-IDF, Sliding Windows).
- **`backend/src/models.py`**: The "Brain". Contains the code for the FCNN, CNN, and LSTM neural networks.
- **`frontend/`**: Contains the beautiful web interface (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
- **`valid_test.csv`**: A sample file provided for you to test the system immediately.

## ❓ Troubleshooting
- **"Models not found"**: You likely forgot to run `python backend/src/train.py` first.
- **"JSON Error"**: Make sure you are uploading a valid CSV file (like `valid_test.csv`) with the correct columns: `timestamp`, `source_ip`, `event_id`.
